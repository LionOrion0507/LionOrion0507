- 👋 Hi, I’m @LionOrion0507
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, videogames, movies, and space.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about programming and how to use it. I have experience in Python, C++, SQL, Typescript & HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to gain experience in front-end development first, then branch into back-end and become a fullstack developer. I primarily use React and Next.js, can use npm & yarn as package managers.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
